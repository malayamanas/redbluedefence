The Federal Security Administration, responsible for protecting sensitive national security information, needed to implement post-quantum cryptography across their entire infrastructure before quantum computers could threaten their current encryption systems. This case study examines how we successfully executed a comprehensive quantum-safe cryptography migration while maintaining operational security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Security Administration manages classified communications and data for multiple government departments, utilizing encryption systems that would be vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. With intelligence estimates suggesting cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge within 10-15 years, the agency needed to begin migration to quantum-resistant algorithms immediately. The challenge involved updating legacy systems, maintaining interoperability, and ensuring no security gaps during the transition period.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Data breach prevention for e-commerce platform</title><link>http://localhost:1313/case-studies/data-breach-prevention/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/case-studies/data-breach-prevention/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;E-commerce platforms handle massive amounts of sensitive customer data, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. This case study explores how we helped a rapidly growing e-commerce company prevent data breaches and protect customer information through comprehensive security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-challenge"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our client, a mid-sized e-commerce platform processing over 50,000 transactions daily, faced increasing security threats as their customer base expanded. Previous security audits had revealed multiple vulnerabilities in their payment processing systems, customer data storage, and third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
